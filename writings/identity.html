      <h1>Identity</h1>

	  <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Someone just asked you, “who are you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        What’s your answer?
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, take that answer and strip away your name, your occupation, your
        gender, your hometown, your ethnicity, and every word that could put
        you into a subset of humanity. What is left?
      </p>

      <p>
        Humans are intelligent. This does not set us apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans can solve hard technical problems. This does not set us apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The human brain is a network of neurons. This does not set us apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not our strength or speed that makes us human. Animals and
        machines outmatch us on that front. So what makes us human?
      </p>

      <h2>Intelligence</h2>

      <p>
        Is it our intelligence? AI has logical reasoning, but so does a
        traditional computer program. What makes AI different is its
        intuition. It may not have reasons for its predictions, but after
        training itself millions of times, softening its flaws, it is often
        accurate.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we identify with our intelligence, learning machines and
        “Artificial Intelligence” blur the lines of our identity.
      </p>

      <h2>Hard work</h2>

      <p>
        What about hard work? Many people will proudly tell you that they
        identify as a hard worker. We often determine whether someone deserves
        success by whether they are a hard worker.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem is, AI can dedicate endless energy to solving a problem. It
        doesn’t get distracted, it doesn’t get tired, and it never complains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Intelligence and Hard Work are traits that many people have and wish to
        have, but they are not what makes us fundamentally human. In the AI
        age, marketing yourself as intelligent and hardworking may start to
        feel generic.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what makes us human?
      </p>

      <h2>Creativity</h2>

      <p>
        Humans create at the frontiers. We push the boundaries of knowledge and
        art. True novel innovation comes from humans who are willing to trust
        their gut and take risks.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI stays in the middle of the boundaries and sticks to what’s safe. AI
        art is usually a softened average of human art. It doesn't like to go
        out of bounds.
      </p>

      <h2>Curiosity</h2>

      <p>
        Humans ask the right questions. We are interested in the knowledge that
        we don’t have. We have invented every system of thought that exists in
        response to confusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        That confusion resulted from our curiosity in the world around us. AI
        doesn’t ask the questions, it’s an answer machine, and the inquiries
        that we approach using AI come from us.
      </p>

      <h2>Care</h2>

      <p>
        We care about each other. We notice the small things about each other,
        and that can mean everything to us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of what we do is for other humans: trying to provide for your
        children, make your parents proud, or uplift humans you’ve never seen
        before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Care isn’t wired into AI the way it is wired into us. AI’s objective is
        technically to generate the response which minimizes the loss
        function. Our goal is to love each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Intelligence and hard work may set you apart from other humans, but
        curiosity, creativity, and care are traits that we all share.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you strip away your name, your occupation, your gender, your
        hometown, your ethnicity, you cannot be put into a subset of humanity.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is nothing left to say but “I am a human being. I am you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I think that in the age of Artificial Intelligence, we should move away
        from identifying with intelligence and hard work. I think it’s time to
        start leaning into our humanity.
